## a bit about myself
I am a wife and mother of two who is **super excited** to learn about Data Engineering.
> I am a BCom Economics graduate and I believe that a *shift into the IT Industry is one of thee best options to secure ones future* especially if you love to constantly learn new things. >> I try to be positive always, ~~**negativity**~~ is quickly banished as I believe all things work out for the best when you put in the work :thumbsup:
